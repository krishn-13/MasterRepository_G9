Assignment Title: Building Hangman Game Repository on GitHub

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to create a team, collaborate on GitHub to create a repository for a Hangman game project using Python, and then share the repository link with the faculty.

Requirements:
1. Each student must have a GitHub account.
2. Basic understanding of Python programming.
3. Collaboration and teamwork skills.

Assignment Steps:

Step 1: Forming Teams
   - Form teams of maximum 3 members each. ( 2 members minimum )
   - Assign roles within the team (e.g., project manager, developer, tester).

Step 2: Creating a GitHub Repository
   - Choose one team member to create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Name the repository something relevant, like "Hangman-Game-Project".
   - Add a brief description outlining the purpose of the repository.

Step 3: Adding Team Members as Contributors
   - The team member who created the repository should add all other team members as contributors with appropriate access levels.
   - Each team member should accept the invitation to join the repository.

Step 4: Designing the Hangman Game
   - Use the given Python Hangman game code as a reference.
   - Discuss and design the game mechanics, including:
     - Choosing a theme for the words (e.g., animals, countries, fruits).
     - Implementing functions for displaying the hangman, checking guesses, and updating the game state.
     - Incorporating features like scoring, difficulty levels, and hints (if desired).

Step 5: Writing README.md File
   - Create a README.md file in the repository.
   - Include details about the project such as:
     - Project title and description.
     - Team members' names and roles.
     - Instructions for running the game.
     - Any additional features or notes.

Step 6: Writing Python Game Code
   - Write the Python code for the Hangman game.
   - Ensure the code is well-commented and follows best practices.
   - Include the necessary functions for gameplay, input handling, and game logic.

Step 7: Testing and Debugging
   - Test the game thoroughly to ensure it runs smoothly and without errors.
   - Debug any issues or errors encountered during testing.
   - Verify that the game mechanics work as intended.

Step 8: Sharing Repository Link
   - Once the repository is set up and the game is ready, share the repository link with the faculty using the provided Google Form link.
   - Ensure that the repository is set to public or accessible to the faculty member.

Submission Guidelines:
   - Submit the GitHub repository link via the provided Google Form link.
   - Ensure that all team members' names are mentioned in the README.md file.
   - Make sure the repository contains both the README.md file and the Python game code (.py file).

Deadline:
   - The deadline for submission is 17th March 2024.
   - Late submissions may incur penalties unless prior arrangements are made with the faculty.

Evaluation Criteria:
   - Completeness and functionality of the Hangman game.
   - Quality of code and adherence to best practices.
   - Collaboration and teamwork demonstrated on GitHub.
   - Clarity and completeness of the README.md file.
   - Timely submission and adherence to deadlines.

Note:
   - Reach out to the faculty or instructor if you encounter any issues or need clarification on any aspect of the assignment.
   - Collaboration and communication within the team are crucial for the success of this assignment.
